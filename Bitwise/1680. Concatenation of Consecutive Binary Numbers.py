1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers
Medium

Given an integer n, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating 
the binary representations of 1 to n in order, modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: "1" in binary corresponds to the decimal value 1. 
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: In binary, 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to "1", "10", and "11".
After concatenating them, we have "11011", which corresponds to the decimal value 27.
